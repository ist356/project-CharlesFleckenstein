### What it does
My code scrapes all of the articles about alfreds from wikipedia, takes their hyperlinks and stores them. Then thrhough streamlit, you can ook up infrmation about a singel article about alfred, or compare the hyperlinks of two different alfred articles(this code can of course be changed)
